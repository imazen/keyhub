
Do the integration tests work on other people's machines ok?
  (They do require stopping IISExpress if its already debugging.  They will delete your localhost database)

Do we need these features?
  Let use disassociate OpenID login
  Let user associated local username/password with their account (we must do email validation in this case)


Poor messaging when registering an existing user account
   -> we should have a link to /Account/LinkAccount somewhere

  
have test username/password in source control (a test gmail account)

  
merge columns User.Email and User.Username into User.Email


resharper test runner stalls if I try to run MSTest tests (it used to work, hmm.  Tests do pass when using VS test runner)
