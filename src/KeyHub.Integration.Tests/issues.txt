Probably need to clear connection string pool.

Possible next steps:
	- Do we have a bug in the DataContext usage?  The code is calling .Dispose() on the contexts, but Windsor expects factory.Release(context) to be used.
	  Windsor may be tracking all these instances.  (if we are releasing the factories, then windsor is fine)

	- explore/understand the existing admin web pages
	    - to enable, need membership role
		- how are the following created?  transactions, licenses, and licensed applications?

	- consider alternatives to domain normalization
	     - Risk is that identifying which domain labels correspond to a top-level domain is non-trivial, and normalization puts that decision making in a hard-to-change-place
		 - Alternative would be to pass the entire domain, but have the license validation look for a domainlicense with a matching substring
	- is the licensing plugin going to be able to detect the domain?  What if the server is behind a load balancer?
	- figure out why google OAuth stopped working


Shelved concerns:
	How to repro 50 character email problem?
	  -> local accounts seem to work ok with long email.  
	  Maybe OpenID has issues?  Hard to test:
		  Google max name size is 30.
		  I have a long MSN account, but microsoft OpenID isn't working  (need appsettings to configure that OpenID provider)


Do the integration tests work on other people's machines ok?
  (warning: They will delete your localhost keyhub database)
  (They do require stopping IISExpress if its already debugging)
  ->  PhantomJS was't installed.  After being installed, it was't on the path.
  ->  It may assume that IISEXpress has had a chance to create a config entry for KeyHub in the user's applicationhost.config



Do we strongly couple the users email with username?


Poor messaging when registering an existing user account
   -> we should have a link to /Account/LinkAccount somewhere

If the user has invalid cookies, they might get forced to error screen 
  (to repro, login locally then delete local database.  This creates a cookie for a non-existant account)

  
have test username/password in source control (a test gmail account)

  
merge columns User.Email and User.Username into User.Email


resharper test runner stalls if I try to run MSTest tests (it used to work, hmm.  Tests do pass when using VS test runner)
