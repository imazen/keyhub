Trying replacing TempData["LoginFailureReason"] with MvcFlash

Check better error messaging when registering an existing user account

Do the integration tests work on other people's machines ok?
  (They do require stopping IISExpress if its already debugging.  They will delete your localhost database)

Do we need these features?
  Let use disassociate OpenID login
  Let user associated local username/password with their account (we must do email validation in this case)

  
User text passed to TempData["LoginFailureReason"] is hard to read
  
have test username/password in source control (a test gmail account)
  
merge columns User.Email and User.Username into User.Email
