TransactionByIpnController.PostTransactionByIpn should have tests


  PrivateKeyController.Remove should be an HTTP post
  PrivateKeyController should use anti-forgery tokens

  - use shared keys for accepting transactions, but those shared keys are in the code
    - vendor should have a UI for managing named shared keys, and they might have multiples


  - authorization of admin pages is only checked if the use is logged in.
    It should check that the user is an admin, or the user is editing something that belongs to them.

  - upgrade to entity framework 6.0?

  - lucrasoft.nl is in the codebase in a few places

  - what to do about usernames that are in the sourcecode?
    - have a default admin and warn people to change it
    - require an appSetting with the admin email, require OpenID login



- Do we have a bug in the DataContext usage?  The code is calling .Dispose() on the contexts, but Windsor expects factory.Release(context) to be used.
	Windsor may be tracking all these instances.  (if we are releasing the factories, then windsor is fine)

- is the licensing plugin going to be able to detect the domain?  What if the server is behind a load balancer?
	
- Google OpenID isn't working for me anymore.  Ugh.  Is it my machine only (new machine)?
  - try the google test account
  - try login with the master branch
  - its working on Nathanael's machine, using 5001

CSS styling is all over, how do I compile scss files?  Should add styles for Flash (.error, .success, etc)

Shelved concerns:
	How to repro 50 character email problem?
	  -> local accounts seem to work ok with long email.  
	  Maybe OpenID has issues?  Hard to test:
		  Google max name size is 30.
		  I have a long MSN account, but microsoft OpenID isn't working  (need appsettings to configure that OpenID provider)
	Microsoft has a new membership system, so maybe we should be using that.

Do the integration tests work on other people's machines ok?
  (warning: They will delete your localhost keyhub database)
  (They do require stopping IISExpress if its already debugging)
  ->  PhantomJS was't installed.  After being installed, it was't on the path.
  ->  It may assume that IISEXpress has had a chance to create a config entry for KeyHub in the user's applicationhost.config



Do we strongly couple the users email with username?
   -> default user (admin) does not have an email, so its hard to make username/email match.

Low priority:  Vendors should be able to edit their vendor page, but not others.

Poor messaging when registering an existing user account
   -> we should have a link to /Account/LinkAccount somewhere

If the user has invalid cookies, they might get forced to error screen 
  (to repro, login locally then delete local database.  This creates a cookie for a non-existant account)

  
have test username/password in source control (a test gmail account)

  
merge columns User.Email and User.Username into User.Email


resharper test runner stalls if I try to run MSTest tests (it used to work, hmm.  Tests do pass when using VS test runner)
