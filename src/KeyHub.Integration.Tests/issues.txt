domain licenses will be generated even if sku.AutoDomainDuration is null
        /// <summary>
        /// How long auto-generated domain licenses are valid before they must be auto-renewed
        /// Leave empty to disable auto domains.
        /// </summary>
        public int? AutoDomainDuration { get; set; }


What algorithm should be used for signing the licenses?  (using SHA256Managed since it is in .NET 2.0)
Did we need to keep the licenses encrypted on the client for any reason?


How to repro 50 character email problem?
  -> local accounts seem to work ok with long email.  
  Maybe OpenID has issues?  Hard to test:
	  Google max name size is 30.
	  I have a long MSN account, but microsoft OpenID isn't working  (need appsettings to configure that OpenID provider)


Do the integration tests work on other people's machines ok?
  (warning: They will delete your localhost keyhub database)
  (They do require stopping IISExpress if its already debugging)
  ->  PhantomJS was't installed.  After being installed, it was't on the path.
  ->  It fails due to a config issue.  Stop bin-copying the config file and use whatever VS has.



Do we strongly couple the users email with username?



Poor messaging when registering an existing user account
   -> we should have a link to /Account/LinkAccount somewhere

If the user has invalid cookies, they might get forced to error screen 
  (to repro, login locally then delete local database.  This creates a cookie for a non-existant account)

  
have test username/password in source control (a test gmail account)

  
merge columns User.Email and User.Username into User.Email


resharper test runner stalls if I try to run MSTest tests (it used to work, hmm.  Tests do pass when using VS test runner)
