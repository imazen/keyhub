Support contracts will all behave like `R3Elite`, but active contracts will also get `R4Elite` when it is released.

Elite and Support contracts will include unlocked versions of Imazen dlls, although it's likely customers will use the NuGet packages regardless, so they will require license support.


## Old Imazen SKUs


Until Feb 1st, 2013, Imazen sold plugin 'bundles'. This approach gave customers lots of choice, but increased confusion, as 4 bundles x 2 license types = 8 SKUs.
