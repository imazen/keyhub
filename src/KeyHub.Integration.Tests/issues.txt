
Nathanael will be out Wednesday (out of office, but maybe on email at end of day), available Thursday afternoon.
If get stuck, move onto the licensing code
  (like https://github.com/imazen/keyhub/issues/36)
  


Put these issues into github (these shouldn't affect the data model, so milestone is afterwards)
  /account/LinkAccount should let user see what openid providers are associated
  /account/LinkAccount should let user disassociate a login account
  /account/LinkAccount should let user associate local password with their account (we must do email validation in this case, or someone could hijack someone's openID login)
  /account/register page asks for email, but allows non-email

How to repro 50 character email problem?
  Google max name size is 30.
  I have a long MSN account, but microsoft OpenID isn't working


Do the integration tests work on other people's machines ok?
  (warning: They will delete your localhost keyhub database)
  (They do require stopping IISExpress if its already debugging)
  ->  PhantomJS was't installed.  After being installed, it was't on the path.
  ->  It fails due to a config issue.  Stop bin-copying the config file and use whatever VS has.



Do we strongly couple the users email with username?



Poor messaging when registering an existing user account
   -> we should have a link to /Account/LinkAccount somewhere

If the user has invalid cookies, they might get forced to error screen 
  (to repro, login locally then delete local database.  This creates a cookie for a non-existant account)

  
have test username/password in source control (a test gmail account)

  
merge columns User.Email and User.Username into User.Email


resharper test runner stalls if I try to run MSTest tests (it used to work, hmm.  Tests do pass when using VS test runner)
