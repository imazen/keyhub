# KeyHub

KeyHub is a portal for customers to view their purchases, generate license keys,
access their private downloads, and configure their error and update notification preferences.

# Develop

You need [Visual Studio 2012 and Web Tools 2012.2](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ReleasedASPNETAndWebTools20122InContext.aspx), and [You must enable NuGet package restore](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages)

We suggest SmartGit as a Git client.
